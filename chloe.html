            <p>CHLOE LARAGAN, 10, passed away with her parents, Karin and Jann, by her side in her home on Sunday, February 11, 2018 in Millbrae, CA. She was also born on a Sunday on December 23, 2007, in Las Vegas, NV, and joined our family on Tuesday, January 22, 2008.</p>

            <p>On her first day home, she pooped on mom. On her last day at home, she pooped on dad. She was perfect.</p>

            <p>Throughout her life, Chloe was an adventurer. She once scaled a five-foot cliff, scaring both her parents. She's hiked 10k peaks, red rock canyons, and redwood forests. She's toured countless vineyards. She's played on beaches all along the California coast. She's even sailed the Pacific. Chloe has seen and done it. During her later years, though, she became an avid napper. No hard surface or awkward sleeping position was ever uncomfortable for a peaceful snooze. Her parents found delight watching her sleep. She also never failed to remind us each night that it was bedtime, "It's 10 o'clock, guys!"</p>

            <p>Her parents found love with everything she was in her short but full life. She had an infectious smile that would disarm you, and a boundless personality that never failed to make you happy. She loved us in different ways, showing us the intelligence behind her sweet brown eyes.</p>

            <p>We love you so much, Chloe. We miss you terribly, and it hurts. We hope we gave you a wonderful life. You certainly gave us one. The hole in our hearts won't swallow the overwhelming joy you brought to 3674 of our days. There is an endless stream of dingoes, Hawaiian bread, and neck rubs waiting for you. Rest in treats.</p>

            <p>It's 10 o'clock, sweetheart. Go to sleep. We'll see you in the morning.</p><hr>
