     <p>Shy of my 15<sup>th</sup> year with a family-owned company, my furlough ended. This career gifted me with friends and fed my ambition building exciting projects. This new life is certainly uneasy, but it has me excited to use my time to study web development. While I work through my personal R&D, I still have a foundation of curiosity to offer, a keenness to learn and understand, an appreciation for collaboration, and steady leadership that was hard-earned on the event floor. I will learn everything, do anything, and go anywhere for any venture that shares these values listed above and showed below.</p>

     <h2>SUPERVISOR - OPERATIONS<br>Freeman | Las Vegas, NV & South San Francisco, CA | 2005 to 2020</h2>
        <p>Controlled 150,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of warehouse activities with  multiple departments, branches, and vendors to create over 260 events each year. My scope covered in-house logistics involving up to 60 laborers focused on fabrication, carpentry, inventory, graphics, freight, and electrical. Our production schedule comprised over 90% of the Moscone Center's calendar including Dreamforce, Oracle OpenWorld, Semicon West, VMWorld, and Winter Fancy Food. While in Las Vegas, my team provided electrical services for over 150 annual events with Freeman's largest branch. Five of these events hosted over 90,000 attendees such as the <abbr title="National Association of Broadcasters">NAB</abbr> Show and <abbr title="Consumer Electronics Show">CES</abbr>.</p>

     <h3>Achievements</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>For my first year, warehouse labor hours were reduced by 3%, beating goal, even though revenue remained flat. As we streamlined operations that same year, expendable costs were reduced 25%. The following years had seen a significant upward trend in revenue. With a sharp focus on efficiency and customer service, we had met each year's challenges to surpass our financial and customer service goals.</li>
         <li>Established updated practices outlined by <abbr title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">OSHA</abbr> and FM Global to refocus on safety. This has ensured that our space and equipment were well-kept. Most importantly, there were no major incidences during my tenure.</li>
         <li>Established a recycling program that have processed over 40 tons of aluminum, 49 tons of acrylic, and 26 tons of cardboard.</li>
         <li>Received the highest score among all our branches by Freeman's Executive VP of Operations for our first warehouse operations audit. Nominated for the Freeman Star of Excellence. Awarded Freeman's MVP Award.</li>
       </ul>

     <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Ensured that our production teams completed all (and overlapping) projects within tight timeframes. Coordinated in-house operations to produce, secure, and ship material to/from multiple branches and vendors for every event. We also assisted other branches with multiple productions each year.</li>
         <li>Managed the branch's rental inventory with the Enterprise Inventory System. Establishing this tracking system allowed me to reliably predict the needs of returning events and lower operating costs. We also lowered our carbon footprint by minimizing the need to ship in unneeded inventory. Conducted bi-annual inventory counts.</li>
         <li>Monitored and evaluated shop process for efficiency improvements. Lead production team in improvements to capacity and capabilities. Oversaw planning of warehouse spaces including storage, organization, and repairs.</li>
         <li>Sourced expendable inventory. Negotiated pricing to ensure costs met budgetary requirements. Monitored material levels and held production accountable for consumption.</li>
       </ul>
