        <fieldset class="intro">
            <p>After 15 years in a career that fed an ambition for building exciting projects, this new world and this unexpected opportunity has me eager to finally dive into a new endeavor. While taking this time to study web development, there will always be a solid foundation to offer any venture that prizes these ideals: a bright curiosity with an enthusiasm to keep learning and improving, an appreciation for collaboration and to bring out the best in each other, and steady leadership.</p>

            <p>Controlled 150,000 ft<sup>2</sup> of warehouse activities with multiple departments, branches, and vendors to create over 260 events each year throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Scope covered in-house logistics involving up to 60 laborers focused on fabrication, carpentry, inventory, graphics, freight, and electrical.</p>

    <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the first year, warehouse labor hours were reduced by 3%, beating goal, while revenue remained flat. Streamlining operations that same year, expendable costs were reduced 25%. The following years saw a significant upward trend in revenue. Each year’s challenges were met with a sharp focus on efficiency and customer service in order to surpass financial and customer service goals.</li>
            <li>Established updated practices outlined by <abbr title="Occupational Safety and Health Administration">OSHA</abbr> and FM Global to refocus on safety. This has ensured that space and equipment were well-kept. Most importantly, there were no major incidences.</li>

            <li>Managed the branch’s rental inventory with the Enterprise Inventory System. Establishing this tracking system helped reliably predict the needs of returning events and lower operating costs. Also lowered the branch’s carbon footprint by minimizing the need to ship in unneeded inventory. Conducted bi-annual inventory counts.</li>
            <li>Monitored and evaluated shop processes for efficiency improvements. Lead production team in improvements to capacity and capabilities. Oversaw planning of warehouse spaces including storage, organization, and repairs.</li>
