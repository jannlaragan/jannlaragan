        <p>Hi there,</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking a look at my first website. Consider this space as my evolving portfolio. I've only just started studying web development so be brutal. Starting out has been immensely fun, and there's a whole world more to get excited for. This site will be changing to test out some of the skills I will be learning.</p>

        <p>For some history, I am part of a pair with my beautiful wife, Karin. Simply, unabashedly, she is my favorite person. For the record, we have yet to perfect our own handshake. I can never remember the moves because I suck. Soon after moving to Las Vegas, we met through a job we mutually disliked; that dislike being the glue that truly brings people together. From there, we would build our own world just for ourselves and our little <a href="chloe.html"><i class="fas fa-dog"></i>, Chloe</a>. After a few years exploring the southwest, we took our chances in the Bay Area, and it's still one of our best decisions.</p>

        <p>Rewinding before Karin and Chloe, I spent a good deal moving and getting into trouble. In between, I explored often; appreciating my luck experiencing far off stretches. So if you ask me where's my hometown, I'll probably say, "It's here now." If you want to know where I'm going, it's off to the next adventure.</p>

        <p>Cheers,<br>Jann</p>
