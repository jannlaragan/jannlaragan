    <p>Hello friends,</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking a look at my first website. Consider this space as my evolving portfolio. I've only just started studying web development, so be brutal. I welcome any constructive feedback to get better. Starting out has been immensely fun, and there's a whole world more to get excited for. This site will be changing constantly to test out some of the skills I will be learning. So if you have a web project in mind, send me an email <a href="mailto:jann.laragan@gmail.com">HERE</a>. I would love any opportunity to keep improving while building you something exciting.</p>

    <p>For some history, I am part of a pair with my beautiful wife, Karin. Simply, unabashedly, she is my favorite person. For the record, we have yet to perfect our own handshake. I can never remember the moves because I suck. Soon after moving to Las Vegas, we met through a job we mutually disliked; that dislike being the glue that truly brings people together. From there, we would build our own world just for ourselves and our little <a href="chloe.html"><i class="fas fa-dog"></i>, Chloe</a>. After about eight years exploring the southwest, we took our chances in the Bay Area. It was one of our best decisions, and the Bay has been good to us since. Whenever we would fly back from a trip, we always felt at ease when the familiar hills and waters of the Bay slowly glided into view.</p>

    <p>Rewinding before Karin and Chloe, I spent a good deal moving, getting into trouble, and living around New Jersey keeping NYC close while my folks worked in the city. Going back further and farther, I lived in Nigeria and the Philippines. In between, I explored often; appreciating my luck experiencing these far off stretches. So if you want to know where I'm from, take your pick. If you ask me where's my hometown, I'll probably say, "It's here now."</p>

    <p>If you want to know where I'm going, it's off to the next adventure.</p>

    <p>Cheers,<br />Jann</p>
